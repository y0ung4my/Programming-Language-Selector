# _Programming Language Selector_


#### By

#### _This is a webpage made to help programmers decide what programming language to learn. The quiz uses a form of radio buttons, which once submitted, will reveal the result of what kind of programming language to learn. First edition of this website includes three choices: C#, Python, and Ruby._


## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery

## Description

Each question is in its own CSS-styled box. The question boxes are hidden when the form is submitted and the result is shown, along with a "start over" button. Once the "start over" button is clicked, the results and "start over" button are hidden again while the results and submit button are shown once again. The scoring system used adds a tally to the programming language each answer is matched with rather than assigning a number value to each answer, leading to less overlap in results.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_Use as a template for further development_
1) open terminal
2) enter the following into terminal: `# git clone https://github.com/y0ung4my/Programming-Language-Selector`
3) to view the webpage as you make changes, you can open the index.html file in a web browser and refresh the page once the changes are saved.

## Known Bugs

* _if there is a tie between two programming languages, the default result is Ruby. Improvement could be made with an added "tie-breaker" question which is only shown in the scenario there is a tie.
